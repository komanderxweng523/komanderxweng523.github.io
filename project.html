				Perpustakaan Tun Abdul Rahman Ya’kub (PeTARY), the Library of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) was established in 1993. The Library was officiated on 17 January 1995 by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim who was the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia at that time, with the name Centre for Academic Information Services (CAIS). However after 26 years being known as CAIS, the Library is now gazetted as Perpustakaan Tun Abdul Rahman Ya’kub (PeTARY), named after the late Tun Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, who was the third Chief Minister of Sarawak and also the fourth Head of the State of Sarawak.

				Academic writing is clear, concise, focussed, structured and backed up by evidence. Its purpose is to aid the reader’s understanding.It has a formal tone and style, but it is not complex and does not require the use of long sentences and complicated vocabulary.Each subject discipline will have certain writing conventions, vocabulary and types of discourse that you will become familiar with over the course of your degree. However, there are some general characteristics of academic writing that are relevant across all disciplines.
			</li>
			<li>To know more about academic writing skills, our lecturer gave an word file example and modity it. By completing this, I have learnt on how to use shortcut key to do my writing effectively.</li>
			<li>This is a very useful skill to help me when doing assignment and project.</li>
